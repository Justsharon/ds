## Algorithm design techniques

1. Brute Force - Simple and exhaustive technique that evaluates every possible outcome to find the best solution example **linear search**
2. Greedy- Choose the best option at the current time, without any consideration for the future. Examples **Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm and Krustal's algorithms** graph data structures
3. Divide and Conquer -  Divide problem into smaller sub problems. each subproblem is then solved and the partial solutions are recombined to determine  the overall solution examples **Binary search, Quick sort, Merge sort and Tower of Hanoi**
4. Dynamic Problem -  divide problem into smaller sub problems. Break it down into smaller but overlapping sub problems. Store the result and reuse it for the same subproblems. This is called memoization and is a optimization technique that improves the time complexity of your algorithm example **Fibbonacci numbers and Climbing staircase**
5. Backtracking - 

### Solve the following
1. Finding the GCD using Eucidian algorithm
2. Finding permutations and combinations of a list of numbers
3. Finding the longest common substring in a given string
4. Knapsack problem
